# Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)
Penetration Testing is a simulated cyberattack performed on a system, application, or network to identify security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. It involves actively attempting to breach defenses, mimicking real-world attack scenarios, and providing actionable insights for improving security.

## Objectives of Penetration Testing

1) Identify Weaknesses:
Detect vulnerabilities in systems, configurations, or code.
2) Assess Risk:
Understand the potential impact of exploitation on the organization.
3) Improve Security:
Recommend mitigations and strengthen defenses.
4) Ensure Compliance:
Meet regulatory requirements such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR.

## Types of Penetration Testing

1) Network Penetration Testing:
Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in network infrastructure (e.g., firewalls, routers, servers).

2) Web Application Penetration Testing:
Examines web applications for flaws like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or insecure authentication.

3) Wireless Penetration Testing:
Targets wireless networks to find issues like weak encryption or rogue access points.

4) Social Engineering Testing:
Simulates phishing attacks or other human-focused exploits to assess staff awareness and response.

5) Physical Penetration Testing:
Tests physical security measures by attempting to gain unauthorized access to facilities.

6) Cloud Penetration Testing:
Evaluates cloud environments for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.


## Stages of Penetration Testing
1) Planning and Reconnaissance:
Define the scope and objectives of the test.
Gather intelligence on the target (e.g., network mapping, public data).

2) Scanning:
Use automated tools to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Exploitation:
Actively exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or escalate privileges.

4) Post-Exploitation:
Assess the impact of successful exploitation, such as data theft or unauthorized access.

5) Reporting:
Document findings, including:
  -Identified vulnerabilities.
  -Exploitation details.
  -Recommendations for remediation.
