# Threath Modeling
Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential security risks in a system, application, or network. 
By understanding the possible threats and vulnerabilities, organizations can implement defenses to mitigate risks proactively.

## Threat model steps

1) Define the Scope
2) Identify Threats
3) Characterize the environment
4) Analyze Threats
5) Mitigate Risks

## Threat Models:
- STRIDE
- PASTA
- Tricke
- VAST

## PASTA threat modeling framework : 

1) Define the business and security objectives
2) Define the scope : 
3) Decompose the application :  work with the app developer to see how the data get from user device to company DB
4) Perform a threat analysis : attacket mindset
5) Perform a vulnerabilty analysis
6) Conduct atatck modeling
7) Analyze risk and impact
