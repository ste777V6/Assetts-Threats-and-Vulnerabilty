# Vulnerability Scanner
A vulnerability scanner is a tool designed to automatically identify security weaknesses or misconfigurations in systems, applications, or networks. It is an essential part of any organizationâ€™s security posture, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

Scanning tools are used to analyze each of the five attack surfaces :
1) Perimeter Layer
2) Network Layer
3) Endpoint layer
4) Application layer
5) Data Layer

## Types of Vulnerability Scanners

#### Network Vulnerability Scanners:
Analyze devices, ports, and network configurations for weaknesses.
Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS.

### Web Application Scanners:
Assess web applications for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Examples: Burp Suite, Acunetix.

### Host-Based Scanners:
Evaluate individual servers, workstations, and endpoints for vulnerabilities in software, configurations, or missing patches.

### Cloud Vulnerability Scanners:
Target cloud environments to ensure compliance and detect risks in cloud-specific configurations.
Examples: AWS Inspector, Qualys Cloud Security.

## Steps in Vulnerability Scanning
1) Setup and Configuration:
Define the scope (e.g., systems, applications, or networks to scan).
Configure scan settings and schedules.
2) Scanning:
The scanner probes the target to identify weaknesses.
3) Analysis:
Scan results are compared with a vulnerability database to determine severity.
4) Reporting:
The tool provides a detailed report, including:
  -Identified vulnerabilities.
  -Their severity level.
  -Recommended remediation.
5) Remediation:
Security teams take corrective action, such as applying patches or updating configurations.
